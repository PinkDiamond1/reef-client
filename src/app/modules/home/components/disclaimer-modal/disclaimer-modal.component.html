    <p class="text-break font-light small">
      Reef is a DeFi operating system â€” a permission-less smart liquidity
      aggregator and yield engine that any financial hub can integrate into.
      Powered by Polkadot, Reef shares its security model with the Polkadot ecosystem and
      enables cross-chain integrations across top DeFi protocols. Reef gives the
      retail investor access to the DeFi landscape by lowering the technical
      barrier of entry.
