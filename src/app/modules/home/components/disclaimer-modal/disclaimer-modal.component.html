      Why Reef?
    </h4>
    <p class="text-break font-light">
      Reef is a DeFi operating system â€” a permission-less smart liquidity aggregator and yield engine where any
      financial hub can integrate into. Powered by Polkadot, it shares its security model with the ecosystem, and
      enables cross-chain integrations across top DeFi protocols. Reef gives the retail investor access to the DeFi
      landscape with a very low technical barrier of entry.

      You are responsible for the safety of your funds and your capital.
      You are by no means guaranteed to make any money using Reef. Even if past performance is high, it is no
      indicator of the future returns.
