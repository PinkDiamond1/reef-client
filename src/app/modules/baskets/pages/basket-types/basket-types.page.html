        Uniswap, Balancer and Mooniswap pools as well as ERC-20 coins</span
      >, which are selected as the highest yielding baskets based on our
      algorithm. You can use our pre-selected pools and ETH allocation in them,
      or you can <span class="font-weight-bold">customize it</span>, using the
      pools/coins you want and choose in which pool or coin you want to invest
      the most ETH. You can also tell our algorithm the level of Risk you want
      to take. This will make the return higher, but might make the loss higher
      as well.
